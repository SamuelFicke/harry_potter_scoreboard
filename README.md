the house_pics directory holds the pictures used to display on the scoreboard. there is one picture for each house.


the audio directory has the sound bytes from the movies used in for constructing the sorting hat speech.
there are three subfolders:
  stalling contains phrases the hat says before selecting a house...just adds some spice to the proccess
  know contains the hat saying "i know" or "i know just what to do with you"
  houses contains the hat saying each house's name

typically, a formed string of audio files to be played is:
  one or more "stalling" files, followed by one "know" file, followed by one "houses" file
